# app.py

# Import necessary libraries:
# - streamlit for the web interface
# - speech_recognition for capturing and transcribing speech
# - difflib for comparing texts
# - os for file operations

# Import classess and functions from other files
#TODO: Create functions for each of the following:
    # see ./ROADMAP.md

def main():
    # Display the app title and description

    # Load pre-established texts from files using load_pre_texts()

    # Create a sidebar for text selection:
        # Option to select a pre-established text
        # Option to input custom text

    # If the user selects a pre-established text:
        # Display a dropdown with available texts
        # Load the selected text

    # If the user chooses to enter custom text:
        # Provide a text area for input
        # Load the custom text

    # Provide an option to practice the full text or in sections:
        # If practicing in sections:
            # Split the text into sections (e.g., paragraphs or sentences)
            # Allow the user to select a specific section

    # Display the selected or entered text on the main page

    # When the user clicks "Start Practice":
        # Indicate that the app is listening
        # Use the microphone to capture audio
        # Transcribe the audio input to text

        # Compare the transcribed text with the original text:
            # Split both texts into words
            # Use difflib to identify differences
            # Highlight words that are missing or incorrect

        # Calculate performance statistics:
            # Total words
            # Number of errors
            # Accuracy percentage

        # Display the highlighted text and statistics to the user

        # Log the session results to a log file for progress tracking

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # run main and display the app in a web browser with checks for microphone access
    main()
