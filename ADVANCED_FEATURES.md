  errorCount: 2,
  hasFeedback: true
}
```

### Intelligent Word Similarity Matching
Advanced phonetic analysis identifies pronunciation variations:

```javascript
// Pronunciation variant detection
{
  expectedWord: "through",
  spokenWord: "threw", 
  similarity: 0.85,
  type: "pronunciation" // vs "substitution"
}
```

### Real-time Streaming Analytics
Live audio analysis with speech detection:

```javascript
// Streaming status
{
  isStreaming: true,
  speechDetected: true,
  volumeLevel: 0.64,
  timeSinceLastSpeech: 1200,
  chunksInBuffer: 3
}
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Phrase Practice
```javascript
// Initialize enhanced app
const app = new EnhancedSpeechMemorizationApp();

// Switch to phrase-based practice
await app.switchMode('phrase-practice');

// Start practice session
await app.startAdvancedRecording();
// User speaks: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
// System analyzes complete phrase and provides feedback
```

### Streaming Recognition Session
```javascript
