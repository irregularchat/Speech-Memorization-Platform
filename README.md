# Speech Memorization Platform

An interactive application designed to help users memorize and practice military creeds and long speeches. The app listens to your speech in real-time, transcribes it, and compares it against the original text, highlighting any discrepancies.

Imagine how lyrics from your favorite songs display on Apple Music or on karaoke apps. Now imagine using that same app to memorize and practice your speeches by gradually increasing the difficulty and removing the displayed words of the text you need to memorize.

**‚úÖ CURRENTLY FUNCTIONAL** - Core features implemented and ready for testing! See installation instructions below.
