# Speech Memorization Platform

An interactive application designed to help users memorize and practice military creeds and long speeches. The app listens to your speech in real-time, transcribes it, and compares it against the original text, highlighting any discrepancies.

Imagine how lyrics from your favorite songs display on Apple Music or on karaoke apps. Now imagine using that same app to memorize and practice your speeches by gradually increasing the difficulty and removing the displayed words of the text you need to memorize.

**âœ… CURRENTLY FUNCTIONAL** - Core features implemented and ready for testing! See installation instructions below.

## Installation

### Local Development

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Microphone access on your device
- OpenAI API key (for enhanced speech processing)
- Google Cloud project (for Google Speech-to-Text)

#### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:irregularchat/Speech-Memorization-Platform.git
   cd Speech-Memorization-Platform
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   **Note**: If you encounter issues with `pyaudio`, install platform-specific dependencies:
   - **macOS**: `brew install portaudio`
   - **Ubuntu/Debian**: `sudo apt-get install python3-pyaudio`
   - **Windows**: PyAudio should install automatically

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys and configuration
   ```

4. **Run database migrations**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py import_texts --military-only  # Load military creeds
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   
   The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8000`

### Cloud Deployment (Google Cloud Run)

#### Prerequisites
- Google Cloud account with billing enabled
- Google Cloud CLI installed and authenticated
- OpenAI API key

#### Quick Deploy
```bash
# Set your project and API key
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key

# Simple deployment (SQLite database)
./deploy-simple.sh
```

#### Full Production Deploy
```bash
# Deploy with Cloud SQL and Redis
./deploy-cloud.sh
```

#### Google Cloud Setup Steps
1. **Install Google Cloud CLI**
   ```bash
   curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash
   exec -l $SHELL  # Restart shell
   ```

2. **Authenticate and set project**
   ```bash
   gcloud auth login
   gcloud config set project your-project-id
   ```

3. **Enable required APIs**
   ```bash
   gcloud services enable speech.googleapis.com cloudbuild.googleapis.com run.googleapis.com
   ```

4. **Set up Application Default Credentials**
   ```bash
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```

5. **Create service account**
   ```bash
   gcloud iam service-accounts create speech-memorization-sa
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding your-project-id \
     --member="serviceAccount:speech-memorization-sa@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
     --role="roles/speech.admin"
   ```

6. **Deploy the application**
   ```bash
   ./deploy-simple.sh
   ```

### Docker Development

For local development with Docker:

```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build

# Or build for cloud deployment
docker build -f Dockerfile.cloud -t speech-memorization .
```

## Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **Backend**: Django 5.2 with PostgreSQL/SQLite
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5 with vanilla JavaScript
- **Speech Processing**: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text + OpenAI Whisper
- **Deployment**: Docker + Google Cloud Run
- **Authentication**: Django's built-in auth system

### Key Features
- **Phrase-based Speech Recognition**: Natural speech flow instead of word-by-word
- **Smart Progression Logic**: Continue even with missed words (60%+ accuracy)
- **Military Creeds**: Pre-loaded Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard creeds
- **Real-time Processing**: WebSocket-based speech streaming (when enabled)
- **Production Ready**: Full cloud deployment with monitoring and backups

### Quick Start
1. **Create account** or use demo credentials
2. **Select a text**: Choose from military creeds or upload your own
3. **Adjust settings**: Use mastery level to control word visibility
4. **Practice speaking**: Natural speech recognition with intelligent progression
5. **Track progress**: Detailed analytics and missed word review


## Usage

### Getting Started
1. **Select Your Text**: Choose from pre-loaded military creeds and speeches, or upload your own `.txt` file
2. **Configure Settings**: 
   - Set your **Words per Minute** (50-300) for scrolling speed
   - Adjust **Mastery Level** (0-100%) to hide memorized words
   - Choose **Recording Duration** (3-30 seconds)

### Practice Modes
- **Static Display**: Read the full text with word masking based on your mastery level
- **Auto-Scroll Mode**: Enable scrolling text that highlights words as you progress
- **Live Recording**: Practice speaking and get real-time transcription and accuracy feedback

### Understanding Your Progress
- **Word Statistics**: Track how many words you've mastered vs total words
- **Performance Analytics**: View accuracy trends, practice streaks, and improvement rates
- **Session History**: Review detailed logs of your practice sessions

### Tips for Best Results
- **Speak clearly** and at a steady pace for better transcription accuracy
- **Start with 0% mastery** to see the full text, gradually increase as you improve
- **Practice regularly** to maintain your streak and see improvement trends
- **Use shorter recording durations** (5-10 seconds) when starting out

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Docker Build Failures**
- Check Docker daemon is running
- Ensure sufficient disk space (2GB+ recommended)
- Review build logs for specific dependency issues

**Speech Recognition Not Working**
- Verify microphone permissions in browser
- Check Google Cloud Speech API is enabled
- Ensure OpenAI API key is valid and has credits

**Database Issues**
- Run `python manage.py migrate` to apply migrations
- Check database connection settings in `.env`
- For SQLite: ensure write permissions in project directory
